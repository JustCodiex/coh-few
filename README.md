# Company of Heroes: Far East War
Welcome to the Company of Heroes: Far East War Github repository. This repository will be hosting the most recent and in-development (Western/Steam[^1]) edition of the mod.

## Setup
Instead of cloning this repository directly into your Company of Heroes folder, please clone it into a copied directory of a freshly-installed version of Company of Heroes. Do this to avoid polluting the repository with unnecessary files or adding files from other mods.

Then open your git-tool (preferably the terminal version) and clone it
```
git clone https://github.com/JustCodiex/coh-few.git
```
Once cloned - boot up the mod studio and select ***Far_East_Mod.module***. If you wish to modify the operations, select ***Far_East_ModOps.module***. Please note that this is technically a separate mod and attributes and art files are somewhat shared.

## Tools
The tool required to mod CoH1 files (.rgd, .rgm, ...) is [Corsix Mod Studio](http://modstudio.corsix.org/). Note, some files, like .ucs and .scar/.lua can be edited directly by a text editor (Some files may be sensitive to encoding).

[^1]: There is an updated Chinese non-steam version out there.

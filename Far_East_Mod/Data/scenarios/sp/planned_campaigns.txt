I belive in the interest of the chinese players there should be a surplus of Chinese campaigns
That does however not mean we cannot show the Japanese perspective.
It's important to show both perspectives in a war, otherwise it becomes too one-sided.
And if you really dislike it, just skip the campaigns you don't want to play.

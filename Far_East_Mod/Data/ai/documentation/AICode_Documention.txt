Using some simple Lua commenting incase the game loads this


I'm guessing we're going to be modifying the AI the next couple of days, so I will begin documenting the work done to the AI, so we can have a more clear
vision of how the AI works

Files:

File: default.ai
Desc: AFAIK this file will be called no matter what, and basically starts up the AI. When reading the files, one should also keep in mind, that the AI file
represents an AI player and not the entire AI system. So this file is "called" for each AI player in the match (Which is why processing heavy duties should be 
avoided at all costs)

InitializeAI is the function called by default in the AI file

Functions:

Full: Request_Production( [Player] playerID, Unkown[TGROUP_BuildOrder], [Number] priority, [Number] cmd, [SquadBluepront] pbg, [Number] hero_id )
Src: strategy_buildorder.ai
Notes: 	hero_id, use "DEFAULT_HERO_ID"
		cmd:
			PITEM_Spawn = "Spawn Unit"
			PITEM_SquadReinforce = "Reinforce Unit"
			PITEM_SpawnHero = "Spawn Hero" -- for an operation?
			
			
]]

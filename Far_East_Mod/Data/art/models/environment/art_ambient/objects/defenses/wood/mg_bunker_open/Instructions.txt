This is made on exactly the same design as an allied mg nest.

So it builds the same way, has its own variable damage.

If you dont want the mg and want it just as a map asset put -- in front of 

"..\\..\\..\\..\\..\\..\\races\\Common\\Weapons\\HEAVY_MACHINE_GUNS",
"..\\..\\..\\..\\..\\..\\races\\allies\\Soldiers\\Weapons\\30Cal_M1917_Browning",

in the abp, this will stop the model reading the hmg side of things.

If you want the nest as the unmanned version occupyable, you will have to copy the allied unmanned mg nest rgd, and point the entity blueprint towards this emplacement. 
You may also need to change the gunner and weapon slot item if you are using the vanilla rgd to copy from.
